# practice-user-management-operations-suganya-p

I was able to practice and refresh my SQL knowledge. It helped how the lesson built step by step on querying the databases. 
Challenges I felt was some of the settings which made its hard to start off with lessons and I learnt that we need to be in the current Schema while we execute the queries the hard way. 


In advanced, It was hard to understand the subqueries. I still have some confusion about which type of subquery we need to use when?
But with more practice, I will be able to get the flow.
